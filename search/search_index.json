Multiple journal files You can configure jrnl to use with multiple journals (eg. private and work ) by defining more journals in your jrnl.yaml , for example: journals: default: ~\\journal.txt work: ~\\work.txt The default journal gets created the first time you start jrnl Now you can access the work journal by using jrnl work instead of jrnl , eg. jrnl work at 10am: Meeting with @Steve jrnl work -n 3 will both use ~/work.txt , while jrnl -n 3 will display the last three entries from ~/journal.txt (and so does jrnl default -n 3 ). You can also override the default options for each individual journal. If your jrnl.yaml looks like this: encrypt: false journals: default: ~/journal.txt work: journal: ~/work.txt encrypt: true food: ~/my_recipes.txt Your default and your food journals won't be encrypted, however your work journal will! You can override all options that are present at the top level of jrnl.yaml , just make sure that at the very least you specify a journal: ... key that points to the journal file of that journal. Note Changing encrypt to a different value will not encrypt or decrypt your journal file, it merely says whether or not your journal is encrypted. Hence manually changing this option will most likely result in your journal file being impossible to load.

How does this work? First, jrnl @alberto will filter the journal to only entries containing the tag @alberto , and then the --tags option will print out how often each tag occurred in this filtered journal. Finally, we pipe this to grep which will only display the line containing @melo . Combining filters You can do things like jrnl @fixed -starred -n 10 -until \"jan 2013\" --short To get a short summary of the 10 most recent, favourited entries before January 1, 2013 that are tagged with @fixed . Statistics How much did I write last year? jrnl -from \"jan 1 2013\" -until \"dec 31 2013\" | wc -w Will give you the number of words you wrote in 2013. How long is my average entry? expr $(jrnl --export text | wc -w) / $(jrnl --short | wc -l) This will first get the total number of words in the journal and divide it by the number of entries (this works because jrnl --short will print exactly one line per entry). Importing older files If you want to import a file as an entry to jrnl, you can just do jrnl < entry.ext . But what if you want the modification date of the file to be the date of the entry in jrnl? Try this echo `stat -f %Sm -t '%d %b %Y at %H:%M: ' entry.txt` `cat entry.txt` | jrnl The first part will format the modification date of entry.txt , and then combine it with the contents of the file before piping it to jrnl. If you do that often, consider creating a function in your .bashrc or .bash_profile jrnlimport () { echo `stat -f %Sm -t '%d %b %Y at %H:%M: ' $1` `cat $1` | jrnl } Using templates Note Templates require an external editor be configured. A template is a code snippet that makes it easier to use repeated text each time a new journal entry is started. There are two ways you can utilize templates in your entries. 1. Command line arguments If you had a template.txt file with the following contents: My Personal Journal Title: Body: The template.txt file could be used to create a new entry with these command line arguements: jrnl < template.txt # Imports template.txt as the most recent entry jrnl -1 --edit # Opens the most recent entry in the editor 2. Include the template file in jrnl.yaml A more efficient way to work with a template file is to declare the file in your config file by changing the template setting from false to the template file's path in double quotes: ... template: \"/path/to/template.txt\" ... Changes can be saved as you continue writing the journal entry and will be logged as a new entry in the journal you specified in the original argument. Tip To read your journal entry or to verify the entry saved, you can use this command: jrnl -n 1 (Check out Import and Export for more export options). jrnl -n 1 Prompts on shell reload If you'd like to be prompted each time you refresh your shell, you can include this in your .bash_profile : function log_question() { echo $1 read jrnl today: ${1}. $REPLY } log_question 'What did I achieve today?' log_question 'What did I make progress with?' Whenever your shell is reloaded, you will be prompted to answer each of the questions in the example above. Each answer will be logged as a separate journal entry at the default_hour and default_minute listed in your jrnl.yaml config file . Display random entry You can use this to select one title at random and then display the whole entry. The invocation of cut needs to match the format of the timestamp. For timestamps that have a space between data and time components, select fields 1 and 2 as shown. For timestamps that have no whitespace, select only field 1. jrnl -on \"$(jrnl --short | shuf -n 1 | cut -d' ' -f1,2)\" External editors Configure your preferred external editor by updating the editor option in your jrnl.yaml file. (See advanced usage for details). Note To save and log any entry edits, save and close the file. Sublime Text To use Sublime Text, install the command line tools for Sublime Text and configure your jrnl.yaml like this: editor: \"subl -w\" Note the -w flag to make sure jrnl waits for Sublime Text to close the file before writing into the journal. MacVim Similar to Sublime Text, MacVim must be started with a flag that tells the the process to wait until the file is closed before passing control back to journal. In the case of MacVim, this is -f : editor: \"mvim -f\" iA Writer On OS X, you can use the fabulous iA Writer to write entries. Configure your jrnl.yaml like this: editor: \"open -b pro.writer.mac -Wn\" What does this do? open -b ... opens a file using the application identified by the bundle identifier (a unique string for every app out there). -Wn tells the application to wait until it's closed before passing back control, and to use a new instance of the application. If the pro.writer.mac bundle identifier is not found on your system, you can find the right string to use by inspecting iA Writer's Info.plist file in your shell: grep -A 1 CFBundleIdentifier /Applications/iA\\ Writer.app/Contents/Info.plist Notepad++ on Windows To set Notepad++ as your editor, edit the jrnl config file ( jrnl.yaml ) like this: editor: \"C:\\\\Program Files (x86)\\\\Notepad++\\\\notepad++.exe -multiInst -nosession\" The double backslashes are needed so jrnl can read the file path correctly. The -multiInst -nosession options will cause jrnl to open its own Notepad++ window. Visual Studio Code To set Visual Studo Code as your editor on Linux, edit jrnl.yaml like this: editor: \"/usr/bin/code --wait\" The --wait argument tells VS Code to wait for files to be written out before handing back control to jrnl. On MacOS you will need to add VS Code to your PATH. You can do that by adding: export PATH=\"\\$PATH:/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/bin\" to your .bash_profile , or by running the Install 'code' command in PATH command from the command pallet in VS Code. Then you can add: editor: \"code --wait\" to jrnl.yaml .

Whenever you don't enter any arguments that start with a dash ( - ) or double-dash ( -- ), you're in composing mode, meaning that you can write your entry on the command line. We intentionally break a convention on command line arguments: all arguments starting with a single dash ( - ) will filter your journal before viewing it. Filter arguments can be combined arbitrarily. Arguments with a double dash ( -- ) will control how your journal is displayed or exported. Control arguments are mutually exclusive (i.e., you can only specify one way to display or export your journal at a time). Composing Entries Composing mode is entered by either starting jrnl without any arguments -- which will launch an external editor -- or by just writing an entry on the command line: jrnl today at 3am: I just met Steve Buscemi in a bar! What a nice guy. Note Most shells contain a certain number of reserved characters, such as # and * . These characters, as well as unbalanced single or double quotation marks, parentheses, and others, likely will cause problems. Although reserved characters can be escaped using \\ , this is not ideal for long-form writing. The solution: first enter jrnl and hit return . You can then enter the text of your journal entry. Alternatively, you can use an external editor ). You can also import an entry directly from a file: jrnl < my_entry.txt Specifying Date and Time If you don't specify a date and time (e.g., jrnl finished writing letter to brother ), jrnl will create an entry using the current date and time. For retrospective entries, you can use a timestamp to tell jrnl where to put the entry. Timestamps can be entered using a variety of formats. Here are some that work: at 6am yesterday last monday sunday at noon 2 march 2012 7 apr 5/20/1998 at 23:42 2020-05-22T15:55-04:00 If you don't use a timestamp, jrnl will create an entry using the current time. If you use a date only (no time), jrnl will use the default time specified in your configuration file (see advanced usage ). Behind the scenes, jrnl reorganizes entries in chronological order. Using Tags jrnl supports tags. Note that because # is a reserved character, the default tag symbol is @ . You can specify your own tag symbol in the configuration file. There is no limit to how many tags you can use in an entry. To use tags, simply preface the desired tag with the symbol: jrnl Had a wonderful day at the @beach with @Tom and @Anna. Although you can use capitals while tagging an entry, searches by tag are case-insensitive. Starring Entries To mark an entry as a favorite, simply \"star\" it using an asterisk ( * ): jrnl last sunday *: Best day of my life. If you don't want to add a date (i.e., you want the date to be entered as now ), the following options are equivalent: jrnl *: Best day of my life. jrnl *Best day of my life. jrnl Best day of my life.* !!! note Make sure that the asterisk ( * ) is not surrounded by whitespaces. jrnl Best day of my life! * will not work because the * character has a special meaning in most shells. Viewing Entries jrnl can display entries in a variety of ways. Entries are filtered using commands preceded by a single dash ( - ). Type jrnl -h for a list of commands. It is possible to see all entries by entering jrnl -until today . However, in most cases you will likely want to use a filter to see specific entries that meet certain criteria. jrnl provides several filtering commands, prefaced by a single dash ( - ), that allow you to find exactly what you're looking for. For example, jrnl -n 10 lists the ten most recent entries. jrnl -10 is even more concise and works the same way. If you want to see all of the entries you wrote from the beginning of last year until the end of this past March, you would enter jrnl -from \"last year\" -until march Filter criteria that use more than one word require surrounding quotes ( \"\" ). Text Search The -contains command displays all entries containing a specific string. This may be helpful when you're searching for entries and you can't remember if you tagged any words when you wrote them. You may realize that you use a word a lot and want to turn it into a tag in all of your previous entries. jrnl -contains \"dogs\" --edit opens your external editor so that you can add a tag symbol ( @ by default) to all instances of the word \"dogs.\" Filtering by Tag You can filter your journal entries by tag. For example, jrnl @pinkie @WorldDomination displays all entries in which either @pinkie or @WorldDomination occurred. Tag filters can be combined with other filters: jrnl -n 5 @pinkie -and @WorldDomination displays the last five entries containing both @pinkie and @worldDomination . You can change which symbols you'd like to use for tagging in the configuration. Note Entering jrnl @pinkie @WorldDomination will display entries in which both tags are present because, although no command line arguments are given, all of the input strings look like tags. jrnl will assume you want to filter by tag, rather than create a new entry that consists only of tags. Viewing Starred Entries To display only your favorite (starred) entries, enter jrnl -starred Editing Entries You can edit entries after writing them. This is particularly useful when your journal file is encrypted. To use this feature, you need to have an external editor configured in your configuration file. You can also edit only the entries that match specific search criteria. For example, jrnl -until 1950 @texas -and @history --edit opens your external editor displaying all entries tagged with @texas and @history that were written before 1950. After making changes, save and close the file, and only those entries will be modified (and encrypted, if applicable). If you are using multiple journals, it's easy to edit specific entries from specific journals. Simply prefix the filter string with the name of the journal. For example, jrnl work -n 1 --edit opens the most recent entry in the 'work' journal in your external editor. Deleting Entries The --delete command opens an interactive interface for deleting entries. The date and title of each entry in the journal are presented one at a time, and you can choose whether to keep or delete each entry. If no filters are specified, jrnl will ask you to keep or delete each entry in the entire journal, one by one. If there are a lot of entries in the journal, it may be more efficient to filter entries before passing the --delete command. Here's an example. Say you have a journal into which you've imported the last 12 years of blog posts. You use the @book tag a lot, and for some reason you want to delete some, but not all, of the entries in which you used that tag, but only the ones you wrote at some point in 2004 or earlier. You're not sure which entries you want to keep, and you want to look through them before deciding. This is what you might enter: jrnl -to 2004 @book --delete jrnl will show you only the relevant entries, and you can choose the ones you want to delete. You may want to delete all of the entries containing @book that you wrote in 2004 or earlier. If there are dozens or hundreds, the easiest way would be to use an external editor. Open an editor with the entries you want to delete... jrnl -to 2004 @book --edit ...select everything, delete it, save and close, and all of those entries are removed from the journal.
